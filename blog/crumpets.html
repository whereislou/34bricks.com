                    <p>I often ponder about whether "McDonald's" burgers were once good. We have a plethora of burger joints now, pumping out delicious, artisan, hipster burgers on brioche buns ... and the quality is GOOD. Take Huxtaburger. Great chef. Great product. And now, popping up at franchises across the state. At what point does the amazing, buttery, full-flavoured huxtaburger turn into your bog-standard, unloved, uninspiring mess that (at best) cures a hangover. I imagine Maccas started out being amazing, once. It's just lost its way.</p><p>The same could be said for crumpets, only I'd never had a good one. There is no "Huxtaburger of the crumpet world". There are just boring, dry, tasteless supermarket crumpets that leave a big un-fillable hole where you were expecting a satisfying breakfast (no pun intended).</p>
                    <p>Now do yourself a favour and BUY YOURSELF SOME CRUMPET RINGS. Then make this recipe. It will change your life. You will never look at a crumpet the same way again.</p><p>Full credit goes to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realbakingwithrose.com/">Rose Levy Beranbaum of the Bread Bible</a>, without whom my obsession with bread would be but a dream.</p>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons of dried skim milk</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon of yeast</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup of water (at room temperature)</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Method</h3>
                    <p>In the bowl of your mixer, fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together the flour, dried milk yeast on low for 20 seconds until combined. Add the salt and mix for a few seconds. Slowly add the water and when combined, increase the speed to medium and beat for five minutes or until completely smooth. It will be soupy.&nbsp;Cover and allow to rise until doubled (about one hour).</p>
                    <p>In a small bowl, mix together the baking soda with 2 tablespoons of water and stir into the batter with a wooden spoon. Allow to rise again until almost doubled and bubbly (about thirty minutes).</p>
                    <p>Preheat a frying pan over low heat. Grease your crumpet rings liberally with butter using a pastry brush.&nbsp;Using a spoon, gently poor the batter into the rings (to about two-thirds full).</p>
                    <p>Cook on low heat until they are golden and crispy on the bottom and until they appear dull on top (you'll see a few bubbles). At this point the crumpet rings should come off easily with the crumpets retaining their shape. Flip them to finish the cooking, you want a nice golden colour there too. I like to eat them straight away, either savoury with a poached egg and some homemade pastrami, or golden syrup and a metric shittonne of butter (my personal favourite). Eat. Swoon. In that order.</p>
